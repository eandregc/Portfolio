(09/23) Terminal Database System.

Academic project for a 5-week course. 
Developed using C++, content as: algorithms for data retrieval, search, and organization.

This was an individual project. I was the code developer. 

Upon execution, the database system prompts the user for the file path of the dataset. 
The program then processes and organizes the data, enabling precise access to specified 
information and defined data ranges. Subsequently, the system generates two output files: 
one with meticulously organized data entries (sorted by Date, Time, Name), and another 
containing the specified range of data. The system provides a user-friendly terminal 
interface for seamless interaction with the organized data, allowing for efficient data 
retrieval and manipulation.
