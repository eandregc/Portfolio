(05/23) Sars-Cov-2 Biological Analisis. 

Academic project for a 5-week course.
Developed using R, content as: Genbank, libraries, classes, lists, arrays, strings. 

This was an individual project. I was the code developer. 

The compiler asks you nothing, all the information is in the code script.
The code analyze the codes for the viruses that are Sars-Cov-2 variants, then
transcript them from raw to string. Finally, setting some comparison graphics 
to analyze their relation between the variants (phylogenetic tree) and their 
composition (nucleotides).
