(07/23) Streaming Simulation (OOP).

Academic project for a 5-week course. 
Developed using C++, content as: classes, dictionaries, file handling.

This was an individual project. I was the code developer. 

Upon execution, the simulation prompts for the file path of the streaming data. The program then reads and 
classifies the content into movies or episodes, allowing for subsequent rating. The categorized content can be 
added to a central video list, and comprehensive data is displayed for user interaction, including details like 
title, duration, genre, and viewer ratings. Users can choose between various display options, such as sorting 
by genre, rating, or release date.
