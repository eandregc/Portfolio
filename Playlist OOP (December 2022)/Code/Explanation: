(12/22) Playlist class (OOP).

Academic project for a 5-week course. 
Developed using C++, content as: classes, lists, arrays, strings.

This was an individual project. I was the code developer. 

The compiler asks you for the name of the playlist, then you can enter in each line the information 
of each song (Autor, album, duration). When you left a white space all the information of all the songs 
in the playlist is display in a music playback format it can select between sorted or random.
