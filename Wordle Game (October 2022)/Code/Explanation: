(10/22)	Wordle Game. 

Academic project for a 3-month course. 
Developed using python, content as: lists, arrays, strings, and files(.csv). 

This was a two-people team project. I was the team leader and code developer. 
The compiler gives you a definition, the user has three attempts to guess the concept word, 
each attempt shows the user the input word letters that are in the same position as the ones of the answer.
